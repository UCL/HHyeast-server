  <h1>Delivering accurate structural bioinformatics to the yeast community with the HHprY data </h1>

  <h3>Welcome to the HHyeast website. </h3>

  <p>This website offers the results of remote homology searches of the entire genome of the model
      budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The searches have been carried out using the HHsearch
      package developed by Johanne Soeding and colleagues [1], a tool also known as "HHpred" through
      its online server [2]. </p>

  <p>The results show visualisations of the strongest homologies for 100% of 6,713 verified yeast open
      reading frames (ORFs) in three databases:

PDB (solved structures)
Pfam (curated protein domain families from the European Bioinformatics Institute)
      the yeast proteome itself. </p>

  <p>For each ORF, the summary of all three that allows you to investigate each set of hits in more detail,
      re-setting the thresholds etc that allow more or less hits to be displayed. </p>

  <h3>Data Download </h3>

  <p>As well as being able to save images of the domain displays through the controls in each window,
      for each ORF the file from which the data has been extracted for the visualisation can be downloaded
      (suffix ".hhr", opened as a text file). </p>

  <h3>Gaps between the domains in the visualisations </h3>

  <p>HHyeast has discovered YYY additional hits in the gaps between the domains displayed here [3].
      Although these are not in the visualisations, it is clear which ORFs have such hits from the download
      buttons, which ... insert text here </p>

  <h3>Job submission </h3>

  <p>Type a gene identifier, either systematic name or standard name if available. The server will offer
      valid options. Typically three panels will be displayed, one for each of the databases (PDB, Pfam Yeast),
      but a panel will not be displayed if no hits reach the default threshold for display. Each panel can
      then be examined in detail allowing re-setting of display thresholds for the other two panels. </p>
